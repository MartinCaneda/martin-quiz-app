- {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  }
  header {
  position: fixed;
  text-align: center;
  background-color: blue;
  width: 100vw;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;

      left: 0 (this is space between the element, header which
      is a block, and the margin of the page, if you don't write
      it there'll be a gap)
      top: 0 (when you set margin top in main, theres a problem,
      you gotta set this to zero in order to fix it)
      }

  .border {
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: black;
  padding: 10px;
  justify-content: space-around;
  }
  body {
  background-color:
  max width: 50vw or percentage;
  margin: auto
  }
  main (you probably don't have it){
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: flex column;
  gap: 10px;
  margin-top:0;
  if you don't do it the header will cover
  the first card, it'll be in front of it
  }

create the first card and then copy. class it with the same name
that way same caracteristics apply
